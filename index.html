    <p>
    I am a PhD candidate studying computer science at Cornell University, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/">Prof. Thorsten Joachims</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests very broadly lay in HCI (human-AI interaction), AI, ethics, and some data visualization.
      I'm also casually interested in research in fields such as those covered by SIGBOVIK :)
    </p>
    <p>
      I was previously a Master's student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Prof. Dan Weld</a> in the <a href="https://hai.cs.washington.edu/">Lab for Human-AI Interaction (HAI)</a> at the University of Washington Seattle.
